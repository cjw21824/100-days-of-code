# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 21, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Removed secrets hard-coded in my discord bot (so bad I know!) and replaced it with a proper Azure KeyVault reference.

**Thoughts:** Although using the Azure Key Vault is a good step in the right direction, the end goal will be to work on a pipeline that will handle the secrets, so credentials no longer have to be cached when running the program. I'm currently using VisualStudioCredentials() to grab the creds from my working instance of VScode. 

**Link to work:** No link, since it's a private repo, but maybe a link to the discord bot's website in the future. Maybe part of this will be it's front end site??
